# Search Comparison: "How does cognee's prune tool work"

## Query
"How does cognee's prune tool work"

## 1. File-Based Search Results

### Method Used
- **Tool**: Grep with context lines
- **Pattern**: "prune"
- **Additional**: Direct file reading of implementation

### Results Found

#### Implementation Files Located:
1. `/cognee/api/v1/prune/prune.py` - Main API interface
2. `/cognee/modules/data/deletion/prune_data.py` - Data pruning logic
3. `/cognee/modules/data/deletion/prune_system.py` - System pruning logic

#### Actual Implementation Details:
```python
# prune.py - Main interface
class prune:
    @staticmethod
    async def prune_data():
        await _prune_data()
    
    @staticmethod
    async def prune_system(graph=True, vector=True, metadata=False):
        await _prune_system(graph, vector, metadata)

# prune_data.py - Removes all data files
async def prune_data():
    storage_config = get_storage_config()
    data_root_directory = storage_config["data_root_directory"]
    await get_file_storage(data_root_directory).remove_all()

# prune_system.py - Clears databases
async def prune_system(graph=True, vector=True, metadata=False):
    if graph:
        graph_engine = await get_graph_engine()
        await graph_engine.delete_graph()
    
    if vector:
        vector_engine = get_vector_engine()
        await vector_engine.prune()
    
    if metadata:
        db_engine = get_relational_engine()
        await db_engine.delete_database()
```

### File-Based Search Strengths:
✅ **Found exact implementation** - Located the actual source code
✅ **Complete technical details** - Shows exactly how it works
✅ **All parameters visible** - Can see optional parameters (graph, vector, metadata)
✅ **Implementation hierarchy** - Found the separation between data and system pruning
✅ **Fast and precise** - Direct access to code

### File-Based Search Weaknesses:
❌ **No context or explanation** - Just raw code, no documentation
❌ **Requires navigation** - Had to follow imports to find actual implementation
❌ **No usage examples** - Doesn't show how to use the tool
❌ **No warnings or implications** - Doesn't explain the consequences

## 2. Cognee Search Results

### A. CHUNKS Search (Vector Similarity)

#### Results:
- Retrieved general architecture documentation
- Found unrelated content (NetBuild project, gitguardian config)
- No specific information about prune tool

#### Analysis:
❌ **Completely missed the target** - Vector search didn't find prune-related content
❌ **Retrieved irrelevant chunks** - Got architecture overview instead
❌ **No prune information** - The knowledge base doesn't contain prune documentation

### B. GRAPH_COMPLETION Search (LLM + Graph Context)

#### Result:
> "The `prune_data` module in the `cognee` package provides a function to handle data pruning, which may include removing unnecessary or redundant records from a database. Although specific details are not provided, it can be inferred that `prune_data.py` contains the logic for identifying and deleting such records based on certain criteria, possibly related to user membership in domains as mentioned in the project knowledge section."

#### Analysis:
⚠️ **Vague and speculative** - Uses words like "may include" and "can be inferred"
❌ **Incorrect inference** - Wrongly associates with membership/domains
❌ **Missing key information** - Doesn't mention prune_system or the dual nature
❌ **No technical details** - Doesn't explain how it actually works

### C. INSIGHTS Search (Graph Relationships)

#### Results:
- Found relationships about NetBuild project
- Listed tech stack connections
- No prune-related entities or relationships

#### Analysis:
❌ **No relevant relationships** - Graph doesn't contain prune tool entities
❌ **Unrelated results** - Shows project knowledge instead

## 3. Comparative Analysis

| Aspect | File-Based Search | Cognee Search |
|--------|------------------|---------------|
| **Accuracy** | ✅ 100% accurate - found exact implementation | ❌ 0-20% accurate - mostly speculation |
| **Completeness** | ✅ Found all components (data + system) | ❌ Only mentioned prune_data vaguely |
| **Speed** | ✅ Instant results | ✅ Fast but wrong |
| **Context** | ❌ No explanation provided | ⚠️ Attempted explanation but incorrect |
| **Technical Detail** | ✅ Complete source code | ❌ No implementation details |
| **Usability** | ⚠️ Requires code reading skills | ⚠️ Misleading information |

## 4. Root Cause Analysis

### Why Cognee Search Failed:

1. **Missing Documentation**: The knowledge base doesn't contain documentation about the prune tool
   - We created 6 documents but none covered the prune functionality
   - The prune tool is mentioned in our MCP tools doc but without implementation details

2. **Knowledge Gap**: The cognify process only processed our created documentation
   - Didn't process the actual source code files
   - Didn't extract information from the implementation

3. **Vector Search Limitations**: 
   - Query "prune tool" didn't match any semantically similar content
   - Retrieved general architecture instead of specific tool info

4. **Graph Incompleteness**:
   - No entities created for prune functionality
   - No relationships linking prune to data deletion or system reset

## 5. Conclusions

### When to Use File-Based Search:
✅ **Looking for implementation details**
✅ **Need exact code or parameters**
✅ **Debugging or understanding how something works**
✅ **Quick verification of functionality**
✅ **When you know file structure**

### When to Use Cognee Search:
✅ **Conceptual questions about documented features**
✅ **Finding relationships between concepts**
✅ **Getting explanations and context**
✅ **When knowledge base is comprehensive**
✅ **Cross-referencing multiple documents**

### Key Takeaway:
**File-based search excels at finding exact implementation details**, while **Cognee search excels at providing context and relationships** - but only when the relevant information has been properly ingested and processed into the knowledge base.

### Recommendations for Improvement:
1. **Add prune documentation** to the knowledge base
2. **Process source code files** with cognify for implementation details
3. **Create explicit relationships** between tools and their functions
4. **Include usage examples** in documentation
5. **Build comprehensive API reference** that covers all tools

## 6. Ideal Solution

The best approach would be a **hybrid system** that:
1. Uses file-based search to find implementation
2. Feeds that into Cognee for context and explanation
3. Maintains comprehensive documentation in the knowledge base
4. Links code implementations to their documentation

This would provide both the precision of file search and the intelligence of semantic search.
